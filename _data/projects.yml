  name: AlloMaize
  description: >
    The AlloMaize project aims at quantifying the growth and developmental regulations (allometry) between the root and the shoot in the model plant maize (*Zea mays*). The project focuses on the events occurring before and after the floral transition. As this stage occurs late in the plant development, the size of the different organs, in particular that of the root system, hinder their observation and analysis. Very little information about the root system exists at these stages.

  name: Flowering Interactive Database - FLOR-ID
  description: >
    The transition to flowering is an essential step of the plant life cycle that is tightly controlled by both endogenous and environmental cues. Its regulation is extremely complex and involves hundreds of genes that are part of highly interconnected pathways. We are currently building a new web-based interactive resource organized around a curated database of the flowering time genes, FLOR-ID. This project is a collaboration with [Fred BouchÃ©](http://www.fredericbouche.com/). Article about the database [here (in french)](http://le15ejour.ulg.ac.be/jcms/c_49741/fr/genetique-de-la-floraison) and [here (Flowering Highlights)](http://floweringhighlights.org/2016/01/21/flowering-highlights-a-database-for-all-things-flowering-by-frank-wellmer/).

  name: Root System Markup Language
  description: >
    Together with researchers from INRIA, CPIB, Juelich, Vienna and Louvain, we created the Root System Markup Language (RSML) that has been designed to alleviate two major bottlenecks: (i) to enable portability of root architecture data between different software tools in an easy and interoperable manner allowing seamless collaborative work, and (ii) to provide a standard format upon which to base central repositories which will soon arise following the expanding worldwide root phenotyping effort.

  description: >
    SmartRoot is a semi-automated image analysis software which streamlines the quantification of root growth and architecture for complex root systems. 
    The software combines a vectorial representation of root objects with a powerful tracing algorithm which accommodates to a wide range of image source and quality. 
    The software supports a sampling-based analysis of root system images, in which detailed information is collected on a limited number of roots selected by the user according to specific research requirements.

    The Plant Image Analysis website is an online, manually curated, database referencing more than 130 plant image analysis software solutions. 
    The website presents each software in a uniform and concise manner enabling users to identify the available solutions for their experimental needs. 
    The website also enables user feedback, evaluations and new software submissions. The aim of such a toolbox is to help users to find solutions, and to provide developers a way to exchange and communicate about their work.

  name:  Water relations in the soil-plant system
  description: >
    Observing the water flows in the soil-plant system is challenging by nature. Until recently, the techniques used were mainly based on averaged estimation of the soil water content variation, down to the plant level. However, in the past few years, new methods have been developed which enabled a more precise observation of the water flows in the soil-plant system.
    In order to decrypt the water dynamics in the SPAC, we combined several phenotyping tools into a small platform. The platform enables the <em>in-situ</em> observation of plant architecture (both root and shoot), plant water status and soil water content.

  name: Science Valorisation
  description: >
    For decades, the only way to valorise one's research was to publish a manuscript in a peer-reviewed journal. While the paper is still the golden standard for scientific productivity, it is not the only one anymore. Nowadays, researchers have access to a wide variety of means to valorise their research.
