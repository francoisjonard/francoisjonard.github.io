Not all papers on root image analysis present a new software and therefore I do not present them on this website. However, some of them are worth reading since they can bring new perspectives or methods that can be useful for all root researchers. So in order to be able to share all the interesting papers I read on root image analysis, I decide to create a group on the [Mendeley website](http://www.mendeley.com) (Mendeley is a free citation manager with several sharing and social features). I am therefore delighted to invite you to consult or even join this group and hope it will turn out to be useful for everyone interested.
